## Introduction
HelloðŸ‘‹, Welcome to My technical assessment :)

**Tools:**


  
  
  âš¡ Appium.

  
  âš¡ TestNg.

## My Approach

- âœ… The first step for me was understanding the Website and doing manual testing.

- âœ… Plan the Required test cases.

- âœ… I used Page Object Model Design and Singleton Design.

  

## Run the test

- ðŸ’ª Clone this repo.

- ðŸ’ª Add the dependencies into Your pom.xml file.
  
- ðŸ’ª Run ```mvn clean test``` .

- ðŸ’ª I did not use the APK directly; instead, I utilized the app package and app activity. Therefore, the application needs to be downloaded as a prerequisite.
